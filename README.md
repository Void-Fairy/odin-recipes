# odin-recipes
A website about a recipe made in the context of TOP (The Odin Project) course.

With this website I plan to learn to use  the HTML knowledge that I before learned in the TOP modules about HTML fundamentals. 

Two further topics i wish to train with this project are getting comfortable with the basic git-commands and the writing of commit messages.
